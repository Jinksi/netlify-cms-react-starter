# 🍉 HyperStatic

A not-so-static site boilerplate:

- **Create React App** for simplicity
- **Styled Components** for component-based css
- **React Router** for routing (v4)
- **React Helmet** for document titles, descriptions, meta
- **React Snapshot** for pre-rendering to static html so it works without Javascript ⭐️

## Get going

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/jinksi/hyperstatic.git
cd hyperstatic
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Build

``` shell
yarn build
```

This will generate static html files for each route into the `./build` directory. Ready for deployment!
